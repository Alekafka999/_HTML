                    Lorem ipsum is a <strong>text used in web design</strong>, <em>typography</em>, layout, and printing
                    in place of
                    English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text.
                    It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or
                    presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the
                    classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or
                    removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or
                    comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has
                    no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin,
                    these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European
                    languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

                    In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to
                    be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's
                    filled with content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by
                    comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely
                    to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to be
                    unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments. Lorem ipsum and
                    its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth
                    century.
